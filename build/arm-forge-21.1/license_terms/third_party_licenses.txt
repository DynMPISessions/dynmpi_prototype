    3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with

    rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually
    been granted by SGI in this License.

    3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
    liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license
    terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will

their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the

       PATENT INFRINGEMENT, SUITABILITY, ETC. AUTHOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
       ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS,
       INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
       MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT,
       OR THAT THE WORK (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF) IS CORRECT, USEFUL,

       to any use of the Work by You.
    8. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
       APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AUTHOR OR THE PUBLISHER BE
       LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
       CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
       LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE AUTHOR

       DAMAGES.
    9. Termination.
        a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
           automatically upon any breach by You of any term of this
           License. Individuals or entities who have received
           Derivative Works from You under this License, however, will
           not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
           or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
           Sections 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 will survive any

           the Work). Notwithstanding the above, the Author reserves
           the right to release the Work under different license terms
           or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
           however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
           this License (or any other license that has been, or is
           required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
           and this License will continue in full force and effect
           unless terminated as stated above.
    10. Publisher. The parties hereby confirm that the Publisher shall
        not, under any circumstances, be responsible for and shall not
        have any liability in respect of the subject matter of this
        License. The Publisher makes no warranty whatsoever in
        connection with the Work and shall not be liable to You or any
        party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including
        without limitation any general, special, incidental or
        consequential damages arising in connection to this license.
        The Publisher reserves the right to cease making the Work
        available to You at any time without notice
    11. Miscellaneous
        a. This License shall be governed by the laws of the location
           of the head office of the Author or if the Author is an
           individual, the laws of location of the principal place of
           residence of the Author.
        b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
           under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
           enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
           and without further action by the parties to this License,
           such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
           necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
           and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
           shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
           with such waiver or consent.
        d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
           parties with respect to the Work licensed herein. There are
           no understandings, agreements or representations with
           respect to the Work not specified herein. The Author shall
           not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear

 #
 #  A large portion of the dictionary entries

 #
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

 #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
 #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
 #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
 #
 #  NO WARRANTY
 #
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
 #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
 #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
 #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
 #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
 #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
 #  any right of any third party.
 #
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
 #
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
 #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
 #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
 #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
 #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
 #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
 #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
 #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
 #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
 #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
 #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
 #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 #  production of secondary products from the program.
 #
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
 #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
 #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
 #  above as far as the program is concerned.

5. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
