/*! \name Standard Utility Functions
 *  \brief Replacements for common libc utility functions.
 *  Since metric library functions need to be async signal safe most
 *  standard libc functions cannot be used. In addition, even basic syscalls
 *  (such as \c read and \c write) cannot be used without risking corruption
 *  of some other metrics the enclosing profiler may be tracking (for example,
 *  bytes read or bytes written). The following functions can be safely called inside
 *  signal handlers and will accommodate I/O being done by the metric plugin
 *  without corrupting I/O metrics being tracked by the enclosing profiler.
